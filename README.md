# @mikilian/rabbitmq-module

A wrapper of the [AMQP library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/amqplib) for [NestJS](https://nestjs.com)
to provide fast communication between services. The idea behind it is to provide possible ways of
communication with a message system without having to write a lot of code.
